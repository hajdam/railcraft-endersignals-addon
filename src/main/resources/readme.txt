Ender Signals Addon for Railcraft Mod
=====================================

Send railcraft signals even to unloaded chunks where you or someone else can receive them once you get there.

Works only between ender controller and receiver.

Primary reason for this plugin was to provide ability to have long distance signals for railway lights/semaphores.
